# Better Erlang Support for Sublime Text 2

Sublime Text 2 comes with basic support for the Erlang programming language,
but most of it is just copied from TextMate and suffers from some pretty annoying bugs.
This repository is an attempt to rectify that situation, providing fixes
for the issues that bug me most.

# Installation

* clone this repository into the ST2 `Packages` folder
* remove the `Erlang` folder inside your ST2 `Packages` folder or (more elegant)
  disable the `Erlang` package in your Global User Config.

# Contributing

Use Github. Pull requests and issues are welcome.
